##  Created using create-react-app, React Router, Spotify API and react-loader-spinner

###  create-react-app

Create React App is a starter to help the creation of single-page app, it comes with Babel, ESlint and Webpack (There are some other packages but it is not necessary to mention them all)

###  React Router
React Router is a declarative routing for React

###  Spotify API

[Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
  

###  react-loader-spinner
React Loader Spinner is a React component for display loaders

[React Loader Spinner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loader-spinner)
  

##  Create your own
### Needs
You will need a spotify developer account (on https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and an application.

Get your Client ID and Secret Client and put it in an .env file in the root of your folder (if you host it, refer to the environment variables part of your host)

### Scripts
####  `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits and you will also see any lint errors in the console.
#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
####  `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
After that, Your app is ready to be deployed!
You may serve it with a static server:

   - `npm install -g serve`
   - `serve -s build`
#### `npm run eject`
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
